 To Multiply the matrices, we first calculate transpose(explained below) of the second matrix to simply our comparisons and maintain the sorted order. So, the resultant matrix is obtained by traversing through the entire length of both matrices and summing the appropriate multiplied values.
Any row value equal to x in the first matrix and row value equal to y in the second matrix (transposed one) will contribute towards result[x][y]. This is obtained by multiplying all such elements having col value in both matrices and adding only those with the row as x in first matrix and row as y in the second transposed matrix to get the result[x][y].

To Transpose a matrix, we can simply change every column value to the row value and vice-versa, however, in this case, the resultant matrix won’t be sorted as we require. Hence, we initially determine the number of elements less than the current element’s column being inserted in order to get the exact index of the resultant matrix where the current element should be placed. This is done by maintaining an array index[] whose ith value indicates the number of elements in the matrix less than the column i.

Now to convolute the matrices, we simply traverse through both matrices element by element,if we come across an element with the same row and column value, we simply multiply their values and insert the product into the resultant matrix.
